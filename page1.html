        The PlayStation  is a video game console that was developed by Sony Computer Entertainment. It was released on September 9th, 1994 for Japan, with later dates for different countries such as North America, Europe, and Australia. The PlayStation was created due to a failed collaboration between Sony Computer Entertainment and Nintendo to create a CD-ROM peripheral for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in the early 90â€™s. A CD-ROM peripheral is something that allows you to play both Nintendo and PlayStation games on the same game console. With the failed collaboration with the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Sony created the PlayStation as its own standalone console. The console was primarily designed by Ken Kutaragi, a Japanese technologist and businessman, and Sony. They put emphasis on the 3D computer graphics that made the game more realistic. This alongside the PlayStation game production being designed to be streamlined and inclusive piqued the interest of third-party support. With the release of the PlayStation, it seemed to popular upon the younger crowd with iconic franchises such as Gran Turismo, Crash Bandicoot, Tomb Raider, and Final Fantasy, which all created sequels of each game.
