        The <i>Playstation 5</i> was first released in late 2020. It was made after and as a successor of the Sony gaming console. The <i>Playstation 5</i> was the first Sony product that supported HD Graphics. It had itâ€™s new and amazing controller called the <i>Playstation </i> Gamepad. This is a  device, with different kinds off buttons and analog sticks. The screen can be helpful to the main display or in supported games to play the game directly on the <I>Playstation 5</i> controller.  The <i>PlayStation 5</i> Pro controller can be used in its place instead of that. This gaming system in backward compatible with all other Playstation home gaming consoles. There are many different controllers for the <i>Playstation 5</i>  gaming console like,  Balance Board, Nunchuk, or the classic controller. Some liked the new PlayStation gaming console and some did not. The public loved the touch screen, the cheap price, more games, and all of the different controllers but some were not happy about the user interface and functionality as well as the battery life, which was short.  The new games were not as great as what they used to be, and people noticed that. They were disappointed and flocked to other companies such as Microsoft. The Sony products are not as popular now but are still used occasionally.
